### Context

This dataset was compiled using a medical study conducted on a group of people.

### Content:

This dataset shows a few variations of head sizes and masses of brains, it also consists additional gender and age group columns.

- **Gender**: 1 for Male, 2 for Female
- **Age Range**: 1 represents > 18 years of age, 2 represents < 18 years of age
- **Head Size(cm^3)**: Head volume in cubic centimetres
- **Brain Weight(grams)**: - Mass of brains in grams

### Question to be answered:

Predict the masses of the brains using the data, and later compare it with the actual masses of brains mentioned in the dataset.
